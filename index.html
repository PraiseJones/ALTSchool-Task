      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a passionate software developer from Delta State, Nigeria, specializing in backend engineering. I began my journey in software development in 2020, driven by a deep interest in technology and a desire to create impactful solutions. Over the past few years, I've honed my skills through self-driven projects, building applications like an Increment App, Scoreboard Calculator, Best Horror Scenes Clone, Quiz App, and a Weather Forecast App. These projects not only reflect my growing technical expertise but also my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.
      
      <br>

        Currently, I am enrolled at the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO), where I am pursuing my studies. Additionally, I am furthering my education with a one-year degree in backend engineering at AltSchool Africa, solidifying my foundation in software development. My dedication to mastering backend technologies, along with essential front-end skills, was nurtured during my time at Zuri Training, where I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.
        
        <br>

        My journey is not just about personal development; it's about preparing to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry. With a strong foundation and a clear vision, I am poised to contribute significantly to the field of software engineering, particularly in backend development, where my passion truly lies.</p>
